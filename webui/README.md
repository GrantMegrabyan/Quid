# Expense Tracker Web UI

SvelteKit frontend for Quid. It persists categories and expenses through the FastAPI backend in `../api`.

## Setup

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Start the API first:

```sh
cd ../api
uv sync
uv run quid-api migrate
uv run quid-api serve --reload
```

Then run the web UI:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The webui reads `VITE_API_BASE_URL` from `.env`; the default is `http://localhost:8000`.

## Scripts

```sh
npm run check     # Svelte/TypeScript checks
npm run test:e2e  # builds preview app and runs Playwright against a live test API
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Playwright owns its own SQLite database at `api/.data/quid-e2e.db`, starts the API with `QUID_TESTING=1`, and seeds test state through the testing-only API endpoints. Do not point e2e runs at the dev database.
